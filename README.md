# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.
This project is to create a etherum contract using scalpio network and then interact with it
```shell
In order to replicate and run 
install the hardhat and intall the npm files 
Create a .env file in the base and add you metamsk private key as well as contract https address and as well as contract address from runnig script deploy.js
to interact with script use intereact.js
deployment :npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
interacting :npx hardhat run scripts/interact.js --network sepolia
```
